ALGLIB++, like its predecessor ALGLIB, is a source-code library meant for direct inclusion in application projects.

There are no libraries or executables to compile and no dependencies on other software libraries.
A Makefile has been provided to implement the equivalent of "make test" or "make check" for the Linux:x86:GCC configuration.
If compiling out of the box for this, or other configurations on POSIX, use this first, and experiment with different settings.
If testing for the first time, it's recommended to run each test separately:
	make TestI && ./TestI
	make TestY && ./TestY
	make TestZ && ./TestZ
	make TestX && ./TestX
	make TestC && ./TestC
Note that TestZ compiles under a different configuration and has, therefore, been set up to compile directly without object files.
Otherwise
	make
or
	make test
will run the tests in the order: TestI, TestY, TestZ, TestX, TestC.

Further details on integrating ALGLIB++ into applications may be found in the ALGLIB++ Reference Manual (Manual.htm).

ALGLIB++ is based on ALGLIB and tracks its upgrades which were, themselves, automatically translated from an internal codebase written in AlgoPascal.
The most recent upgrades are the following:
∙	ALGLIB 4.0 (forthcoming)
∙	ALGLIB 3.19.0 (forthcoming)
∙	ALGLIB 3.18.0 (source code generated 2021-10-25)
∙	ALGLIB 3.17.0 (source code generated 2020-12-27)
∙	ALGLIB 3.16.0 (source code generated 2019-12-19)
∙	ALGLIB 3.15.0 (source code generated 2019-02-20)
∙	ALGLIB 3.14.0 (source code generated 2018-06-16)
∙	ALGLIB 3.13.0 (source code generated 2017-12-29)
∙	ALGLIB 3.12.0 (source code generated 2017-08-22)
∙	ALGLIB 3.11.0 (source code generated 2017-05-11)
∙	ALGLIB 3.10.0 (source code generated 2015-08-19)
ALGLIB++ is licensed under the same GPL restrictions as the GPL version of ALGLIB, with a special exception made to allow the improvements, repairs or other changes made in ALGLIB++ to be used by the original developers of ALGLIB in both their GPL and commercial versions.

ALGLIB++ undergoes a process of automated upgrade/reengineering/refactoring/testing.
It does not use version numbers but, instead, is marked by the timestamp of the most recent test.
The latest updates of the testing and development sequence are listed in section A6 of the ALGLIB++ Supplementary Sections (Notes.htm).
The timestamp of the current revision is 1650824757 (62659635).
