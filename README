ALGLIB (C++) Version 3.18.0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This is a copy of version 3.18.0 of ALGLIB, recoded and assimilated into ALGLIB++.
It was subject through the same stages of recoding that led from the distribution version of ALGLIB to ALGLIB++,
in order to have the recoding sequence on record.

It remained operational throughout the process, with the final result merged into ALGLIB++,
where it has now been moved into, thereby also updating ALGLIB++ from 3.17.0 to 3.18.0.

Other changes, following the merger, including new multi-threading code, recently devised
and further nativization into C++, are pending.

The last revision, at the time of merger, passed its tests with timestamp 1652120083 (62795a13).
