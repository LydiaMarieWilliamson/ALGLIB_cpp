ALGLIB++, like its predecessor ALGLIB, is a source-code library meant for direct inclusion in application projects.

There are no libraries or executables to compile and no dependencies on other software libraries.
A Makefile has been provided to implement the equivalent of "make test" or "make check" for the Linux:x86:GCC configuration.
If compiling out of the box for this, or other configurations on POSIX, use this first, and experiment with different settings.
If testing for the first time, it's recommended to run each test separately:
	make TestI && ./TestI
	make TestY && ./TestY
	make TestZ && ./TestZ
	make TestX && ./TestX
	make TestC && ./TestC
Note that TestZ compiles under a different configuration and has, therefore, been set up to compile directly without object files.
Otherwise
	make
or
	make test
will run the tests in the order: TestI, TestY, TestZ, TestX, TestC.

Further details on integrating ALGLIB++ into applications may be found in the ALGLIB++ Reference Manual (Manual.htm).

ALGLIB++ is based on ALGLIB and tracks its upgrades which were, themselves, automatically translated from an internal codebase written in AlgoPascal.
The most recent upgrades are the following:
∙	ALGLIB 3.20.0 (forthcoming)
∙	ALGLIB 3.19.0 (source code generated 2022-06-07)
∙	ALGLIB 3.18.0 (source code generated 2021-10-25)
∙	ALGLIB 3.17.0 (source code generated 2020-12-27)
∙	ALGLIB 3.16.0 (source code generated 2019-12-19)
∙	ALGLIB 3.15.0 (source code generated 2019-02-20)
∙	ALGLIB 3.14.0 (source code generated 2018-06-16)
∙	ALGLIB 3.13.0 (source code generated 2017-12-29)
∙	ALGLIB 3.12.0 (source code generated 2017-08-22)
∙	ALGLIB 3.11.0 (source code generated 2017-05-11)
∙	ALGLIB 3.10.0 (source code generated 2015-08-19)
∙	ALGLIB 3.9.0 (source code generated 2014-12-11)
ALGLIB++ is licensed under the same GPL restrictions as the GPL version of ALGLIB, with a special exception made to allow the improvements, repairs or other changes made in ALGLIB++ to be used by the original developers of ALGLIB in both their GPL and commercial versions.

The recoding of ALGLIB to ALGLIB++ was originally carried out based on version 3.8.2 (released on 2013-11-25)
and has been continuously upgraded with each revision of ALGLIB, since then.
Starting with version 3.16.0, a public-facing copy was placed on GitHub and has since undergone resynchronization to 3.17.0.

For version 3.18.0, in addition to resynchronizing to the update, a separate branch was created from the distribution version, in the repository ALGLIB_cpp_3_18,
and subject to the same stages of recoding that led from the distribution version of ALGLIB to ALGLIB++,
in order to have the recoding sequence on record.

It remained operational throughout the process, with the final result merged into ALGLIB++,
where it has now been moved into, thereby also updating ALGLIB++ from 3.17.0 to 3.18.0.
The last revision, at the time of merger, passed its tests with timestamp 1652120083 (62795a13).

Other changes, following the merger, including new multi-threading code, recently devised,
new DSP routines slated for addition to the FastTransforms module
for time-frequency and time-scale analysis (and hybridizations of the two),
and further nativization into C++, are all pending.

ALGLIB++ undergoes a process of automated upgrade/reengineering/refactoring/testing.
It does not use version numbers but, instead, is marked by the timestamp of the most recent test.
The latest updates of the testing and development sequence are listed in section A6 of the ALGLIB++ Supplementary Sections (Notes.htm).
The timestamp of the current revision is 1659302551 (62e6f297).
